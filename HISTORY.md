## Quick Onboarding
New Claude sessions: Run these queries first to get context:

```sql
-- Current project notes
SELECT topic, note FROM session_notes WHERE status = 'active' ORDER BY topic;

-- Asset inventory  
SELECT category, asset_type, notes FROM project_assets ORDER BY category;
```

## Known Issues
⚠️ **CSS Animation Bug**: Pages use reveal animations that hide content (`opacity: 0`) until JavaScript triggers. If JS doesn't execute, content stays hidden. Fix: Set content visible by default, animate only when `.js-loaded` class present.

- 3D visualization/CAD capabilities demonstrated across multiple project types

## UNVERIFIED / SONNET SPECULATION (Do NOT use without Brian confirming)
- "25+ personal injury cases" — Brian needs to confirm actual number

- Fort Worth residential, Austin hotel, Houston country club cases — may be fictional examples Sonnet created
- "Westfall Forensic Services" as entity name — not confirmed as registered
- Specific pricing tiers ($2,500 / $4K-$8K / $10K-$25K) — verify Brian agrees with these
- Daubert compliance claims — verify actual expert witness experience

## CONFIRMED FICTIONAL (Label clearly as demos)
- Szablowski condo pool accident scenario — hypothetical demo only
- Any forensic animation scenarios built from the condo model

## ACTION ITEMS BEFORE BUILDING FORENSIC PAGE
1. Brian to confirm: How many actual forensic/litigation cases completed?
2. Brian to confirm: Is Monmouth Beach a real case or hypothetical?
3. Brian to confirm: Preferred single business entity name for forensic work
4. Brian to confirm: Pricing structure accuracy
5. Brian to confirm: Any real attorney relationships/testimonials?

### Page Title / Meta
`Pool Damage Inspections & Insurance Reports | Brian Lee Westfall`

### Hero Section Heading
"Forensic Inspections & Damage Assessment"

### Body Copy
> With over 20 years of industry experience I provide expert pool inspections for two critical situations:
>
> **Insurance Claims (Fire, Flood, & Storm):**
> I act as a neutral expert to distinguish between normal age-related wear and actual insurable damage. My reports provide fair, market-accurate repair estimates that help resolve claims quickly and honestly.
>
> **Pre-Purchase Home Inspections:**
> Don't rely on a general home inspector for your pool. I perform specialized testing to catch expensive problems—like plumbing leaks or structural failure—before you buy. My goal is to ensure your dream home doesn't come with a nightmare pool.

### Images on Page
6 Pool Inspection Damage photos archived in Supabase Storage and local ZIP.
Current Adjusters Licence image also on page.
